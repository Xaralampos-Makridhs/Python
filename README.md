# Python Data Structures Course

Welcome to the Python Data Structures course repository! This repo contains all the exercises, projects, and code examples that I have worked on while learning and practicing various data structures in Python.


## Introduction
This repository is a collection of Python files that demonstrate the implementation and usage of key data structures. Through this course, I have covered several data structures such as:

-`List`
-`Tuple`
-`Queue`
-`Dictionary`
-`Strings`
-`Files`

The purpose of this repository is to showcase how different data structures are implemented and used.

## Data Structures Covered

The following data structures have been covered:

1. **Lists**: Working with dynamic arrays, indexing, slicing, adding/removing elements.
2. **Tuples**: Immutable sequences and their use cases.
3. **Sets**: Set operations, uniqueness, and membership testing.
4. **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, efficient lookups, and data organization.
6. **Queues**: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) operations, implementing queues using lists.
